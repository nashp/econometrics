\title{The Convenience Yield and Commodity Currencies: A Not So Random Walk}
\author{Peter Nash}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper uses the information inherent in the shape of commodities futures curve, specifically the convenience yield, to determine a relationship between this yield and commodity currencies. We investigate the properties of this yield and propose a predictive relationship between this and future returns of commodity currencies. We show that for certain currencies and commodities this relationship holds and there is some predictive power in this yield. We propose that because the convenience yield gives an insight into current supply-demand dynamics, that is a high convenience yield and low inventories show strong contemporaneous demand, this is positive for commodity producers.
