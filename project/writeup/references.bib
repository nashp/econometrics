The convenience yield is a decreasing, nonlinear function of inventories. Price measures, such as the futures basis, prior futures returns, prior spot returns, and spot price volatilities reflect the state of inventories and are informative about commodity futures risk premiums. We verify these theoretical predictions using a comprehensive data set on 31 commodity futures and physical inventories between 1971 and 2010.

  abstract={This paper analyzes the extent to which information in commodity futures markets is useful for out-of-sample forecasting of commodity currencies. In the earlier literature, commodity price changes are documented to be weak out-of-sample predictors of commodity currency return. In contrast, we find that the basis of several commodities may contain useful information, but the usefulness of any particular commodity basis varies over time and depends on the nature of the commodity. In particular, it seems the basis of commodities with relatively high storage costs tend to be more useful. We argue that high storage costs will tend to make the basis more prone to fluctuations in commodity risk and therefore provide information about the risk premium for commodity currencies. We implement forecast combination strategies that take full advantage},

 abstract = {This paper investigates whether oil prices have a reliable and stable out-of-sample relationship with the Canadian/U.S dollar nominal exchange rate. Despite state-of-the-art methodologies, we find little systematic relation between oil prices and the exchange rate at the monthly and quarterly frequencies. In contrast, the main contribution is to show the existence of a very short-term relationship at the daily frequency, which is rather robust and holds no matter whether we use contemporaneous (realized) or lagged oil prices in our regression. However, in the latter case the predictive ability is ephemeral, mostly appearing after instabilities have been appropriately taken into account},

First, real exchange rates are mean-reverting, as implied by the Purchasing Power Parity model. Second, the adjustment takes place via nominal exchange rates. These features of the data can be exploited, even on the back of a napkin, to generate nominal exchange rate forecasts that outperform the random walk. The secret is to avoid estimating the pace of mean reversion and assume that relative prices are unchanged. Direct forecasting or panel data techniques are better than the random walk but fail to beat this simple calibrated model. JEL Classification: C32, F31, F37, F41},

We argue that this result helps explain the well known puzzle that fundamental variables such as relative money supplies, outputs, inflation and interest rates provide little help in predicting changes in floating exchange rates. As well, we show that the data do exhibit a related link suggested by standard models - that the exchange rate helps predict these fundamentals. The implication is that exchange rates and fundamentals are linked in a way that is broadly consistent with asset pricing models of the exchange rate.},

abstract = {Historically, fund managers and investors making portfolio allocation decisions have considered emerging market equities a separate asset class. More recently, a number of economic, legal, accounting, and financial developments have eroded the root differences between emerging and developed country financial markets. These liberalizations include capital market reforms that have reduced the constraints and limits on foreign portfolio investment. The authors find that empirical evidence strongly supports the view that the world{\textquoteright}s financial markets are becoming increasingly integrated, and that the integration process encompasses emerging markets. As a result, the idea of a rigid separation between emerging market and developed market pools of investible funds (and adoption of separate performance benchmarks) seems no longer appropriate. Indeed, recent moves by international investors to benchmark their portfolios to MSCI{\textquoteright}s all{\textendash}country world index and related world indexes, which include both emerging market and developed market securities, seem a step in this direction.},

The theory of storage explains the difference between contemporaneous futures and spot prices (the basis) in terms of interest changes, ware-housing costs, and convenience yields. We find evidence of variation in the basis in response to both interest rates and seasonals in convenience yields. The second model splits a futures price into an expected premium and a forecast of the maturity spot price. We find evidence of forecast power for 10 of 21 commodities and time-varying expected premiums for five commodities.}
