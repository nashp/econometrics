knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Notes

The example in Log likelihood $L(\theta) = f(y_1, \theta)f(y_2, \theta)f(y_T, \theta)$, we are assuming each sample is independent, 
what if this is not the case? e.g. if $y_t$ is not independent of $y_{t-1}$, e.g. if we take the price of an equity this is not 
indpendent, but if we take the return this would be independent.



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
